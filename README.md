# Motion-Feedback-System-for-2-Servo-motors
for this project i should open one of the servo motors and attach a wire to the potintiometer for the feedback, i will simulate this process by connecting potintiometer to the A0 pin to read the value(assume the potintiometer is coming from one of the servo motors), i mapped the value to angle and pass it to the servo motors, so whenever we move one servo the other should move in the same way
